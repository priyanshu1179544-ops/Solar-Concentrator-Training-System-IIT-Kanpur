# Solar-Concentrator-Training-System-IIT-Kanpur
Performed experimental evaluation of a dual-axis parabolic trough solar concentrator, analyzing heat transfer, efficiency, and system performance under varying flow rate, insolation, wind speed, and ambient conditions using water and oil as working fluids. Gained hands-on experience with solar tracking sensors, receiver tubes.
